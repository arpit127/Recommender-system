# Recommender-system
In this model I have created a content based recommender engine which makes use of K-NN algorithm to find out the top 5 similar movies to the movie that the user has given as input.I have discussed in detail about the K-NN algorithm in this model.The file "Weighted features.py" contains the code of what output is given by the recommender system if we give different weights to different features selected for movie recommendation. I have also plotted graphs on the basis of the error metrics average rank and % of movies in the top 5 recommended movies.I have analysed which 3 movies should always be recommended by our recommendation engine after searching the top similar movies on google and shortlisting 3 movies based on our dataset and based on that calculated the top above mentioned error metrics. For further references I have attached the report file along with this project files.
